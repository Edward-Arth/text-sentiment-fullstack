This project is my first venture into Python, and machine learning via the Python library scikit-learn. I train a support vector machine (SVM), using a dataset of 25,000 IMDB movie reviews, to predict whether strings of text have a positive or negative sentiment.

I incorporate my model into a simple web app that I built. The backend is written in Python using Flask, and the frontend is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript using React.
